# Kotlin (MVVM)
 
# Architecture
Demo project for showing the architecture of Android project using MVVM, Clean architecture and Kotlin coroutine Flow 


## App Architecture
Here we will follow the guidance provided by Google on application architecture  to prepare a clean code architecture. 
Application architecture follows Solid principles (domain layer added using use cases)



## Functionalities
* Home Screen showing movie list 
* If item view is pressed, a Detailed Screen is shown with more details.

## Testing
* UnitTest
    * apis
    * viewmodels
